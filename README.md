this is just a project i am working on this is not the best code you have ever seen but i am new so please cut me some slack.

the api i am using is BrainShop.ai its a free api its not the best but i will try making to chatbot using chatgpt or maybe even gpt-4

Usage:

first you have to a a Key.py file in your directory as Sara.py after adding that you have to go to
https://brainshop.ai
then create your brain go to its settings copy the "API URL:"
go to the Key.py file you created earlier and paste this:
info = {
"API URL": "[api key]"
}
then just run the sara.py file
